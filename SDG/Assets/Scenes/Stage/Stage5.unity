    longText: Since 1978, when China started to implement the policies of reform and
      opening-up, various special economic zones were established, such as the city
      of Shenzhen in Guangdong Province in the 1980s, the new district of Pudong in
      the Shanghai Municipality in the 1990s, and Zhongguancun in Beijing in the late
      1990's. It has been forecasted that Zhongguancun will become the leader of China's
      hi-tech industry in the 21st century.

      opening-up, various special economic zones were established, such as the city
      of Shenzhen in Guangdong Province in the 1980s, the new district of Pudong in
      the Shanghai Municipality in the 1990s, and Zhongguancun in Beijing in the late
      1990's. It has been forecasted that Zhongguancun will become the leader of China's
